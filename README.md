# Mechatronics
Design of mechatronic systems : IR sensors, Waldo Mechanism, Combat Robot
Built an IR photodetection circuit, using phototransistors, opamps and ATmega32U4, achieveing accuracy over 2 m.
Designed and implemented a 3-DOF interactive input and output device with ADC-based potentiometer control for precise
servo movement, featuring custom CAD design and laser-cut fabrication for structural components to mimic a dancer.
Built an autonomous combat robot, implementing wall-following and WiFi-controlled navigation using ESP32 microcon-
trollers, TOF sensors, custom circuit boards, I2C communication between sensors, and servo-controlled attack mechanism
